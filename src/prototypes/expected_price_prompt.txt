I'd like you to write a template for the following Dash App.

The aim of the app is to let the user know how far an apartment he is
looking to rent strays for the expected price per m2 in the area. To
do this, the user filters per Belgian municipality and per range of
living area.

I'm taking care of computing expected price per m2 in the backend and
other data is also work that is done in the back end. Hence, I'm just
looking for a shell containing the relevant logic and the html
front-end.

Here is how the app should be structured:

- On the left side, there is a menu with the living area and the
  municipality as filter.

- On top, an interactive figure is shown. It consists of a straight
  horizontal line with the marked expected price per m2 given the set
  filters. Points on the line are example offerings for that living
  range in that municipality. Markers also indicate x% prediction
  interval around the expected price per m2.

- At the bottom, there is a chloropeth map divided into the regions of
  the different Belgian municipalities. Color intensity vary according
  to the expected price per m2 at the filtered set living area.
